We use OpenCV eye and circle detection to determine the Degree of Strabismus (crossed eyes) in individuals using simple phone cameras.

A Web Api takes images on from the user, runs the vision code, and provides feedback based on the results.

This main motive behind this is to provide a quicker and much cheaper alternative to going to an eye doctor.

I was in charge of the vision code and my friend, Peter Chen, was pivotal in creating the Web Api.
